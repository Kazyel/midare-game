# Midare - A Simple CLI Game
**Midare** is a simple **CLI game**, a **RPG based in Python**. The idea of the project started after finishing the two initial courses from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) and I felt that I needed something for practicing and fixation of some main concepts both of Python and Object-Oriented Programming.

### 📝 Still need to be implemented:
- New Gameplay Mechanics - 🔜
- Game Balance - 🔜
- The Shop, Items, Buffs - 🚧
- Code Refactoring and organization - 🚧
- Error Handlers - 🚧

### ⚡Running the game:
First, you gonna need **Python 3.10+** installed on your computer.<br>
