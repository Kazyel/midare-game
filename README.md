# :fire: Midare - A Simple CLI Game
Midare is a simple CLI game, a RPG based in Python. The idea of the project started after finishing the two initial courses from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) and I felt that I needed something for practicing and fixation of some main concepts both of Python and Object-Oriented Programming.

### Still need to be implemented:
- Game Balance
- Unfinished Game Mechanics 
- The Shop, Items, Buffs
- Code Refactoring and organization
- Error Handlers
